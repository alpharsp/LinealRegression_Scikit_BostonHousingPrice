# LinealRegression_Scikit_BostonHousingPrice
This is an example of how to use Lineal Regression with real data, this time we are using the Boston Housing Price dataset. Some interesting features in addition to the Machine Learning tools are techniques such as the generation of a correlation Matrx (Which uses Pearson's correlation coefficient formula), seaborn heatmaps which are useful to visualize the correlation data and some other plotting tools embedded in seaborn's library such as regplot and jointplot.
